# Welcome to www.baonnguyenphoto.com

This is the showcase for my photography work. However, lies beneath the website is the combination of
several technologies for small/medium project like Java, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, Postgresql, Mockito and AWS

## Quick Introduction
It's quite simple. You'll see:
* **Home** page (or index page)
* **About** page (information to contact me)
* **Gallery** (here you'll see my work)
* A hidden page that I call **Admin console** (the heart of my website) that's used for managing my photos and categories. But you'll need to login

Just like that. All the basic stuff

## That's all
Simple and very basic. But it'll have more features coming in the future
