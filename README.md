# Welcome to www.baonnguyenphoto.com

This is the showcase for my photography work. However, lies beneath the website is the combination of
several technologies for small/medium project like Java, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, Postgresql, Mockito and AWS

## What you'll need to run this project?
You'll need to have:
* Github
* An IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VScode, VS Studio, Notepad...whatever)
* Postgresql installed

Just like that. All the basic stuff

## Installation
1. Clone project
2. Modify the _**application.properties**_ file to point to your DB
3. npm run install

Boom!!! You're all setup and ready to go

Urghhh....I didn't commit my _**application.properties**_ cause it contains my personal information.
So...contact me if you need the file, or you can create one :)

## Quick Introduction
It's quite simple. You'll see:
* **Home** page (or index page)
* **About** page (information to contact me)
* **Gallery** (here you'll see my work)
* A hidden page that I call **Admin console** (the heart of my website) that's used for managing my photos and categories. But you'll need to login

## That's all
Simple and very basic. But it'll have more features coming in the future
